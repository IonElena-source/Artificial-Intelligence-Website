            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, 
                is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence
                displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as
                the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment
                and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
                Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines
                (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind,
                 such as "learning" and "problem solving".</p>

                    As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require
                    "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon
                    known as the AI effect. A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever
                     hasn't been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is
                    frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a
                    routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally classified
                    as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at 
                    the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),
                    autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery 
                    networks, and military simulations.
                 </p>
                 <p>The applications for artificial intelligence are endless.
                    The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries.
                    AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs
                    and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the
                    operating room.
                    Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers 
                    that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh 
                    the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the
                    end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving
                     cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute 
                    it to act in a way that prevents a collision.

                    Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, 
                    where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such 
                    as unusual debit card usage and large account depositsâ€”all of which help 
                    a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help 
                    streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, 
                    and pricing of securities easier to estimate.

                    At a very high level artificial intelligence can be split into
                    two broad types: narrow AI and general AI.
                    Narrow AI is what we see all around us in computers today: 
                    intelligent systems that have been taught or learned how to carry out 
                    specific tasks without being explicitly programmed how to do so.
                    This type of machine intelligence is evident in the speech and language 
                    recognition of the Siri virtual assistant on the Apple iPhone, 
                    in the vision-recognition systems on self-driving cars, 
                    in the recommendation engines that suggest products you might like based 
                    on what you bought in the past. Unlike humans, these systems can only learn 
                    or be taught how to do specific tasks, which is why they are called narrow AI.
                    There are a vast number of emerging applications for narrow AI: 
                    interpreting video feeds from drones carrying out visual inspections of infrastructure 
                    such as oil pipelines, organizing personal and business calendars, responding to simple
                    customer-service queries, co-ordinating with other intelligent systems to carry out tasks 
                    like booking a hotel at a suitable time and location, helping radiologists to spot potential
                    ors in X-rays, flagging inappropriate content online, detecting wear and tear in elevators
                    from data gathered by IoT devices, the list goes on and on.
                    Artificial general intelligence is very different, and is the type of adaptable
                    intellect found in humans, a flexible form of intelligence capable of learning
                    how to carry out vastly different tasks, anything from haircutting to building 
                    spreadsheets, or to reason about a wide variety of topics based on its 
                    accumulated experience. This is the sort of AI more commonly seen in movies,
                    the likes of HAL in 2001 or Skynet in The Terminator, but which doesn't exist
                    today and AI experts are fiercely 
                    divided over how soon it will become a reality.
