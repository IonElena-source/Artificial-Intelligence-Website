                        This is one of the biggest advantages of Artificial 
                        intelligence. We can overcome many risky limitations of humans
                        by developing an AI Robot which in turn can do the risky things for us. Let it be going to mars, defuse a bomb, explore the deepest parts of oceans, mining for coal and oil, it can be used effectively in any kind of natural or man-made disasters.
                        Example: Have you heard about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
                        explosion in Ukraine?
                        At that time there were no AI-powered robots that can help us 
                        to minimize the 
                        effect of radiation by controlling the fire in early stages,
                        as any human went close to the core was dead in a matter of minutes.
                        They eventually poured sand and boron from helicopters from a mere distance.
                         AI Robots can be used in such situations where
                        intervention can be hazardous.

                        The phrase “human error” was born
                        because humans make mistakes from time to time. Computers,
                        however, do not make these mistakes if they are programmed properly. With Artificial intelligence, the decisions are taken from the previously gathered information applying a certain set of algorithms. So errors are reduced and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility.
                        xample: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced 
                        the majority of human error.

                                Artificial intelligence can benefit the economy by helping

                                 Robots and AI will help people perform their tasks better,
                                 not take their jobs. The combination of man and machine will be unstoppable.

                                With deep learning and machine learning, AI can become 
                                smarter over time, thus increasing a business' efficiency.
                                 AI will also significantly reduce the probability of human 
                                 error and study historical data to cut costs.

                                    AI not only increases productivity at the machine level, it also makes worker
                                    s more productive and increases the quality of the work they do. Having more
                                     information allows them to have a more focused 
                                    view of their work and make better decisions.
                                    The AI market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 52% 
                                    from 2017 to 2025, according to a recent report from Research and Markets.

                                    Machine automation produces quality products faster and more efficiently,
                                     while providing critical information to help managers make more informed 
                                     business decisions. There are still some hurdles, however: Many companies are
                                      reluctant to share sensitive production and process data. There is also the 
                                      challenge of integrating vast amounts of data, from both the shop floor and 
                                    the back office, to create real time insights.

                Ingesting, sorting, linking, and properly using data has become 
                increasingly difficult as the amount of unstructured data being 
                ingested from sources such as the web, social media, mobile devices,
                sensors, and the Internet of Things has increased. As a result, 
                it’s easy to fall prey to pitfalls such as inadvertently using or revealing 
                sensitive information hidden among anonymized data. For example,
                while a patient’s name might be redacted from one section of a medical 
                record that is used by an AI system, it could be present in the doctor’s
                notes section of the record. Such considerations are important for leaders 
                to be aware of as they work to stay in line with privacy rules, such as the
                European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California
                Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), 
                and otherwise manage reputation risk.

                    failed to spot trading

                        Social media through its autonomous-powered algorithms is very

                        and are incredibly good at surmising what we think. Investigations 
                        are still underway to determine the fault of Cambridge Analytica and 
                        others associated with the firm who used the data from 50 million Facebook 
                        users to try to sway the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and
                        the U.K.'s Brexit referendum, but if the accusations are correct, it illustrates
                        AI's power for social manipulation. By spreading propaganda to individuals 
                        identified through algorithms and personal data, AI can target them and spread
                         whatever information they like,

                            it will obviously take over jobs that were once performed by humans. 
                            According to a report published by the McKinsey Global Institute,
                            around 800 million jobs could be lost worldwide because of automation
                            by 2030. But then the question arises “What about the humans that are
                            left unemployed because of this?” Well, some people believe that many
                            jobs will also be created because of Artificial Intelligence and that
                             may balance the scales a bit. People could move from physical and 
                            repetitive jobs to jobs that actually require creative and strategic 
                            thinking. And people could also get more time to spend with their friends and family with less physically demanding jobs
